An API key table with an array of allowed domain names and ip addresses.
- Management of keys can be done from a server side script.
- All that is required is a validate_api_key function.

Basic requirements of the API are as follows:
- Player looks for a game lobby.
- If there are two Player's looking for a game then they are matched.

We may have to Player's Table which holds a guid, gdevelop username, status, last_activity_timestamp, search_timestamp (creation).

The status may be:
- SEARCHING.
- PLAYING.
- TIMED_OUT.
- DISCONNECTED.

Players who have been waiting for the longest will be matched to a game.

A Lobby will contain a guid, players structure (array?), game data (json structure).
